### Things to note
* This demo is intended to validate our product and focuses on the core feature of evaluating bids per the most advantageous combination.
* We are currently in discussions with procurement managers/public buyers, so the evaluation sample file is subject to change.
* The demo lacks defensive coding or error checks, so you will not be notified if something breaks.
* It is recommended to use the demo in the presence of a team member to observe your usage and make necessary updates to the app.
